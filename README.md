## About My Google Foobar

`My Google Foobar' is a collection of code submissions to and notes detailing my thought processes about the Google Foobar Challenge. I tried my best to capture my brainstorming, strategies, and both failed and successful attempts in the .ipynb files as they were happening in real-time.

I ONLY USED NATIVE PYTHON. I think used pre-built libraries to solve coding puzzles is unfun. :)

## Gotta Collect Them All!
I enjoyed all the riddles quite a bit, which prompted me to find more riddles like it. As it turns out, Google Foobar has a a whole pool of puzzles that get randomly assigned to each challenger. I decided to attempt the puzzles that I didn't get assigned to as well, and include them in this repo.

To my knowledge, this is a comprehensive list of every Google Foobar challenge related to the bunny story arc.

## File Naming Structure
My naming structure is as follows:
a.b.zz.filename_main.ipynb

a = the level/difficulty of that puzzle
b = the sublevel of that puzzle; some levels (like level 3) have multiple challenges*
zz = if a file has this in its name, then it's a duplicate puzzle that was renamed by Google over the years.
filename = the puzzle's name

*If the file has a 'x' here instead of a number, it means it was a Google Foobar challnege that I found online. The solutions for these '.x' challenges are unverified.
